Hello, this is the landing page for your personal website!

Go ahead and play with the file named `index.md`.

Try adding an image using the following syntax:

{% highlight html %}

![Clifton Campus] (http://www.baileygomm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/clifton-campus-nottingham-trent-university-6.jpg)

{% endhighlight %}

![Nottingham Trent University] (http://www.baileygomm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/clifton-campus-nottingham-trent-university-6.jpg)

Or you can go to the Posts section, look at the first post to see how to create your own.

Why don't you tell us about yourself?
